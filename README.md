# Case Study #1 - Danny's Dinner

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study: sales, menu, members

Insights and findings

In 1st week 2 runners signed up, in 2nd week only 1 runner signed up & in 3rd week also only 1 runner signed up.

The average time it took for runner_1 is 15.33 minutes, runner_2 took 23.40 minutes while runner_3 took 10 minutes to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pick up the order.

We can say more number of pizzas will take higher time to prepare than preparing 1 pizza.

Average distance travelled for customer 101 is 20 km, for customer 102 is 18.4 km, customer 103 is 23.4 km, customer 104 is 10 km while for customer 105 is 25 km.

The difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders is 44 minutes.

Runner’s speed is higher in case of shorter distance than the longer distance for runner 1. While in case of runner 2 this pattern doesn’t follow for all the orders as in case of same distance, there is huge different in his speed.

The successful delivery percentage for runner 1 is 100%, runner 2 is 75% while runner 3 is 50%

# Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments
Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.
